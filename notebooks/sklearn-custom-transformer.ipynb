    "Scikit-learn comes with a number of useful built-in data transformation functions that allow you to [impute missing values](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.impute), [scale numerical data](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.preprocessing), etc. Eventually, however, you will want to manipulate your data in a way that is not supported by the built-in offerings. Fortunately, it's not too hard to construct your own transformer that can easily be integrated with the greater sklearn workflow.\n",
